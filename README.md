# Vue Restaurant Menu Generator

## Overview

Something that really bothers me is when I go to a website and there is only a link to a PDF menu. I get that is the easiest way to provide information to the customer and some information is better than no information. But it there are many issues that come with providing a hard copy of the menu:

* It gets outdated quickly
* You do not know if the restaurant is sold out of any items
* downloading breaks the flow of a restaurant website

So I created a dashboard where the user (Admin) can create a customized restaurant menu.
